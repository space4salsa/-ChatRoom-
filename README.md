   ```
4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - Windows:

## Accessing from Other Devices

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   - **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt and look for the "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in Terminal and look for your local network IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).
2. **On other devices (phones, tablets, laptops) connected to the same Wi-Fi or LAN:**
   - Open a web browser and enter:
     ```
     http://<your-ip-address>:3000
     ```
     (Replace `<your-ip-address>` with the IP you found above.)

## Optional: Friendly Name (mDNS)

- If your network supports mDNS, you can use `http://lanlounge.local:3000`
- On Windows, you may need to install [Bonjour Print Services](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US)

## File Sharing

- Click the paperclip icon (ðŸ“Ž) to select and share files (images, docs, etc.)
- Images will appear directly in the chat
- Files are stored in the `uploads` directory
- Shared files are accessible to all users in the chat
